# Team Agreement

## Team 11 - VR

**These are the terms detailing the professional practice and management approach that we agree to abide by as a team.**

## Meeting Schedule

As a team we agree to meet up every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

We agree that during each meeting we will have stand-ups explaining what we have done, what needs to be done next and what has been completed.

We agree to communicate every day to determine what has been done and/or alert other members of any issues.

## Methodologies

We agree to perform daily stand-up meetings where each team member will outline what they have done since the last meeting, problems encountered and what they are planning to work on until the next meeting.This is an Agile Methodology which we will implement into our team work; making sure we work together effectively and efficiently. 

We agree to use Taiga for project management:
* Use Kanban, User Stories and tasks to organise our workload
* Carry out code reviews
* Implement Pair Programming where relevant
* Use the Card Sorting methodology to decide functionality after client meetings

  
## Definition of Done

As a team, we agree that a user story is defined as 'done' only if the code produced has been completed, has passed all of the necessary unit tests and has received approval via a code review from another member of the team after being reviewed. When demonstrated, it must pass the defined acceptance and performance criteria(s) within the user story to show that it delivers a clear value to the client and meets their requirements.

## Definition of Ready

As a team, we agree that a user story is ready if:
* It follows I.N.V.E.S.T criteria
* The tasks written for the user story follow S.M.A.R.T
* The business value is clear and the details of the requirements are sufficiently understood by all members within the team
* The acceptance criteria is relevant and testable
* The dependences are identified and the feature can be demonstrated once produced during the sprint review meeting.


## Communication

As a team, we agree to use Microsoft Teams, Facebook and/or WhatsApp as our forms of communication to share and save code.
We agree to use a GitLab Repository and the Microsoft Teams group that have been setup for the project.
We agree that we will be using Taiga for project management to clearly organise and display what each team member is doing, what needs to be done and what has been completed.


## Working Agreement

As a team, we agree that there will be a daily scrum meeting every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday/Friday during the course of the project. During these meetings, we will be discussing what we did yesterday, what we intend to do today and if there are any impediments that occurred or we expect to occur.

We will use a branch structure in git to avoid merge conflicts. There will be feature branches which will be used to create individual features for the application and will be a duplicate of the development branch. All features will be merged into the development branch once they are working correctly with all the content already in there. The master branch will be updated every friday morning and will be merged with the working application in the development branch. Before merging each feature branch into the development branch, merge the development branch into the feature. This way you can check that everything in your feature branch is compatible with the development branch. When there are no issues, merge your feature branch into the development branch.

Approaching the end of every sprint, we agree to test the application developed during the week, to ensure that it is functioning as planned and expected. If everything meets the expected criteria then we agree to merge the development into the master branch. At the end of every sprint - every Thursday or Friday subject to the availability of all team members - we will have Retrospectives to reflect on what we have done in the previous sprint and what we will do in the next sprint. Our working agreement complies with the CUESIP Code of Conduct for Student Group Projects, which explicitly states that all team members should seek, accept and offer honest criticism of technical work. It also states that each member of the team should acknowledge and correct errors in their technical work with the relevant authorization of the team.
