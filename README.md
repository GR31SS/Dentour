## Features

As this tour has been designed for teenagers between the ages of 12-16, special features and considerations have been implemented/taken to enhance their experience;

- Interactive Quizzes

Throughout the tour, users are encouraged to participate in a 'true or false' quiz. All questions, answers and extra information has been taken from the [American Dental Association](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/Teens/fact-or-fiction). This will hopefully increase users excitement and prompt them to look around all rooms to gather more important information. 

- Bright and eye-catching colour schemes 

Using [ColorSafe Guidelines](http://colorsafe.co/), this project is accessible for as many as possible. Icon colours, information cards and prevention guidelines have all been designed based on WCAG Guidelines of text and background contrast ratios. This enabled us to create a beautiful tour with accessible colour palettes.

- Assisted Speech  

Increasing accessibility is such an important part of this project. Decreasing a child's fear is the main aim, any child/user should be able to reap the benefits of this tour. This is where assisted speech comes in. All prevention guidelines and user information messages have been recorded for users to listen to as well as read. As the project progresses more of the icons, room names and help instructions will be accessibly for visually impaired users. 



## Tests

To run the tests in a command prompt use
```
npm test a
```
This ensures that ALL tests written are run.
